I love SML. After some evenings and nights with _Java_, I'm really glad to go back to this old but still good language.

## interpreters and  compilers

The easiest implementation is _PolyML_ which have an interpreter and a good compiler. The project is still alive, which is very important.

_MLton_ is a good compiler, which is easy to use but it have no interpreter. The last version is from February of this year and the previous from 2013. Low activity but not null.

The historic _SML/NJ_ implementation offers an interpreter with a compiler. The latter is not easy to use and I don't want to use it.

There are more but today I will only use these.
