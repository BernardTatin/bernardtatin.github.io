title: SML, the revenge

I love SML. After some evenings and nights with _Java_, I'm really glad to go back to this old but still good language. Some of my work in progress can be find there: [TheReturnOfTheSonOfSML](https://github.com/BernardTatin/TheReturnOfTheSonOfSML). In this post, I just recall some basic rules that I forget after a few weeks of inactivity in this domain.

## interpreters and  compilers

The easiest implementation is _PolyML_ which have an interpreter and a good compiler. The project is still alive, which is very important.

_MLton_ is a good compiler, which is easy to use but it have no interpreter. The last version is from February of this year and the previous from 2013. Low activity but not null.

The historic _SML/NJ_ implementation offers an interpreter with a compiler. The latter is not easy to use and I won't.

There are more but today I will only use these.

##  a sample program

There is a great `hello` project which can help us to learn how to structure a source for _PolyML_ and _MLTon_. If there is a strong standardisation of the language, it's not the case of the compiling system. It's why we must do different things for each implementation.

### _PolyML_, first steps

It' a very permissive system whith one rule: you must provide a `main` function as the entry point of your program:

```sml
fun main() =
	print "Hello, world!\n"
```

Put that code in a file called `hello1.sml` and run this:

```bash
$ polyc -o hello1.exe hello1.sml
$ ./hello1.exe 
Hello, world!

```

### _MLTon_, first steps

Now, testing with _MLTon_ give a unexpected result:

```bash
$ mlton hello1.sml
$ ./hello1

```

If we create a `main.sml` like this:

```sml
(* main.sml *)

val _ = main ()
```

and a sort of project file `hello1.mlb` like that:

```sml
$(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb

hello1.sml
main.sml
```

The test can give us now what we expect:

```bash
$ mlton -output hello1.mlt.exe -verbose 1 hello1.mlb

$  ./hello1.mlt.exe

```

The `-verbose`  option give some indication of the evolution of the compilation. Even if it's verbose, it's useful for big project because the compiler is really slower than `polyc`.
