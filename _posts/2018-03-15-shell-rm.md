# using the command line

## `du` and the biggest directory

`du` is a nice tool which can show you the total space occupied by all the files of a directory:

```bash
$ du -sm /bin /lib*
13	/bin
952	/lib
6	/lib32
1	/lib64
```

In that command, I asked the size of `/bin` and of all `/lib*` directory (flag `-s`)  and the result is in megabytes (flag `-m`). On my computer, `/bin` files use 13 Mb. With `sort` and `head`, we can find the directories which occupies the most disk space:

```bash
$ du -sm /usr/local/* | sort -rn | head -3
4408	/usr/local/tools
928		/usr/local/java
141		/usr/local/bin
```

If I need to free space on my disk, I will clean `/usr/local/tools` in first, it occupies 4 Go. And to know more, I now do:

```bash
cd /usr/local/tools && du -sm * | sort -rn | head -3
1699	OracleDeveloperStudio12.6-solaris-x86-bin
883		idea-IC-173.3942.27
721		smalltalk-X
```

I can win more than 1 Gb by removing _Oracle Developer Studio 12.6_ which I do not use since a long time.

## several commands and error handling

The last simple in [`du` and the biggest directory](#`du` and the biggest directory) show the use of `&&` between the two commands which could be written like that:  

```bash
cd /usr/local/tools; du -sm * | sort -rn | head -3
...
```

We will get the same result than before (unless I have deleted _Oracle Developper Studio_). If I did
