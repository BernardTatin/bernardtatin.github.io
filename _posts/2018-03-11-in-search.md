## in search of the magical CSS

I did what I said, and so many said before and after me: ***don't do that***. No shame, I did it. If you look at my _sass_ files, you'll find some:

```sass
html {
  font-size: 100%;
  ...
  body {
    background: $white;
    ...
    section {
      margin: 0 auto;
      ...
      section {
      	...
        article {
          ...
          section {
          	...
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I've done a copy of the HTML structure. It's really nice to understand what we are doing, it's the way _CSS_ should work and it's really bad.

A few years ago I've read that browser where really good to find `id` and `class` in that order. So the most performant pages could be written with only `div`, `id` and `class`. so why `section`, `article`, `header` and `footer` You give them an `id` or a `class`, the tag name does mean nothing, you can invert `header` and `footer`.
