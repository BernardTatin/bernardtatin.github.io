## in search of the magical CSS...

I said so many times to so many beginners: ***don't do that***. In fact, without shame, I did it. I took a simple aim, which was **simplify _css_**, and I open files in _Atom_ to modify them as quick as I could. Current conditions where the following:

- I was so tired because of the lack of sleep,
- I was trying to find some music from 60's and 70's,
- I always did something else while editing as phoning, playing with the dogs and so on.

And you get all the _sass_ and _Liquid_ stuff which is in a poor condition even if the result is viewable.

If I want a clean code, the job will be 10 times harder than if I had think twice before modifying the files, but without shame, ***I did it***, and it's a big failure for the _future_ of my code.
